    <h2>What's so special about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"target="_blank"><u>Bangladesh?</u></a></h2>
    <p>It is no secret that Bangladesh, long ago, captured and continues to hold my heart. As I commented on that sad day a decade ago when I departed Dhaka at the end of my ambassadorship, <b>"I am leaving Bangladesh, but my heart is staying behind,"</b>so it remains. <br>Those who know my enduring affection for Bangladesh sometimes ask, "What is so special about Bangladesh?" This question has a simple answer: the people—the wonderful people of Bangladesh—are the reason that the country is so special for me. During my tenure as US ambassador to Bangladesh, I visited all 64 districts, and everywhere I travelled I saw Bangladeshi men and women—farmers, village women, teachers, medical workers, street vendors, shopkeepers, businesspeople, ready-made-garment workers—all working hard and creatively to build a peaceful, secure, prosperous, healthy and, aspirationally, democratic Bangladesh, a far-cry from the <i>"international basket case"</i> that a US diplomat envisioned in 1971 for the then newly-independent nation.</p>
